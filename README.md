## Proposed Project
 We created a recycling application that aims to help people recycle more by seeing the recycling process as a game at the end of which they will receive rewards.

## UML Diagrams
All the UML diagrams can be found [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_le1A484=/?share_link_id=783683109578). 
If you can't see the diagrams, zoom out until they will appear on the left side of the screen. 

We have:
- One General Diagram - State diagram
- Three Behavioral Diagrams
- Three Class Diagrams 


## Design patterns
The backend of the application was built in Node.js using the Express framework, the frontend was built in React.js and the database is a non-relational one - MongoDB.

Design patterns:
- Middleware Pattern: We used this pattern [here](https://github.com/alexandragrecu/AMSS-Project/blob/main/backend/controllers/authController.js).
- Singleton Pattern: We used this pattern [here](https://github.com/alexandragrecu/AMSS-Project/blob/main/backend/server.js).
